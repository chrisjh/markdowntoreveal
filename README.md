MarkdownToReveal.js
========

An all-in-one application for converting Markdown files to beautiful Reveal.js presentations. Batteries included, some assembly required.

To use:

- Make sure you have [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)  
- Clone the repository  
- Run `npm install`
- Run `node app` to start the webserver on localhost:8000
- Run `node mtr path/to/your/file.md`
- Visit localhost:8000/file.html to see the Reveal presentation.

Don't like the theme/slide/transitions/whatever? Just edit the HTML file to suit your needs or to add Reveal functionality.
